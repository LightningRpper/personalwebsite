# Jack B. Stevenson Personal Website

This is a website I am currently working on as a means to learn more about programming and show potential employers what I am capable of when it comes to jobs focusing on software development. It is also acting as a way to easily access resources that might be enticing to everyone, like links to projects I created/had involvement in creating, an easy way to access my YouTube account, or just an update blog showing development on a project. I am prioritizing functionality at the moment, but I do plan to stylize and clean up my work when everything works as intended.

Pages so far:

 * Home Page: Introductory page meant to show the basis of what I can do an what I enjoy.

 * Projects I was involved in: Easy access to GitHub repositories of note worthy projects I made or helped make.

 * My YouTube account: A link to my YouTube account and a way to promote videos I've made recently. Aiming to implement video players so they can be watched on this site.

 * Blog of Updates: A page where I give short blogs on videos, games, or certain softwares currently in development.
 
 * Fundraisers: A page where I promote all the fundraisers I am currently participating in. I heavily appreciate the support!

 * Download Resume: A way to download a pdf file of my resume for potential employers. 

 * Contact Me: An easy method of contact. Meant to send emails to my central account.
